# UI Patterns

This document defines how UI is written in this project. The goal is a consistent, maintainable, and accessible interface.

## Language

- All user-facing copy must be in English unless the user explicitly asks for another language.
- All code, comments, prop names, and CSS custom properties must be in English.

## No hardcoded strings

- Every user-facing string must come from a centralized source: i18n keys, design-system tokens, or a constants file.
- Do not write labels, placeholders, or error messages directly in components.

```tsx
// ✅ Good
import { t } from 'shared/i18n';

<Button>{t('order.submit')}</Button>
```

```tsx
// ❌ Bad
<Button>Submit order</Button>
```

## No redundant copy

- Do not repeat information already shown by a title, icon, selected state, or surrounding section.
- Prefer concise labels over explanatory text when the state is self-evident.
- Remove disabled placeholder actions unless they teach a real next step.

```tsx
// ❌ Bad
<div>
  <h1>Orders</h1>
  <p>This section shows your orders.</p>
</div>
```

```tsx
// ✅ Good
<div>
  <h1>{t('orders.title')}</h1>
  <OrderList />
</div>
```

## Semantic styling

- Use semantic design tokens instead of physical colors.
- ❌ Avoid: `bg-white`, `text-black`, `zinc-500`.
- ✅ Prefer: `bg-bg`, `text-text`, `border-border`, `text-muted`.
- Theme differences must live in one place (global theme file or CSS variables). Do not scatter `dark:` or media queries across components.

## Components are small and focused

- A component should do one thing.
- Extract a new component when a file grows beyond ~300 lines or when a block is reused.
- Components receive data and callbacks through props; they do not fetch their own data unless they live in a feature slice and that is the slice's explicit responsibility.

## Layout rules

- Use Flexbox to partition the screen into stable regions (header, content, footer).
- Only designated containers scroll. Do not allow the body or arbitrary containers to scroll.
- Set `min-height: 0` on every flex container that participates in the scroll chain.
- Set `min-width: 0` (`min-w-0`) on every flex or grid item that can contain
  wide content — a code block, a table, an unbroken URL. A grid or flex item's
  automatic minimum size is its *min-content* width, so without it the column
  widens to fit its widest child and takes the whole page sideways with it; the
  `overflow-x-auto` on that child never gets to engage. This is the horizontal
  twin of the `min-height: 0` rule above and it fails the same silent way:
  invisible at desktop widths, a broken page on a phone.
- Content of unknown width (anything rendered from a readme or other
  third-party source) needs `break-words` so an unbreakable token wraps instead
  of overflowing, and wide blocks scroll inside their own `overflow-x-auto` box.
- The page root should fill the viewport (`min-h-dvh` / `h-dvh`).

## Affordances must survive touch

- Never hide a control behind `hover` alone. A touch device has no hover, so an
  unconditional `opacity-0` leaves the control permanently invisible on every
  phone and tablet.
- Scope the hidden state to pointers that can hover, and let touch simply have
  the control: `[@media(hover:hover)and(pointer:fine)]:opacity-0`. Keyboard
  users get it back with `focus-visible`. `REVEAL_ON_HOVER` in
  `shared/ui/copy-button.tsx` is the shared form of this.

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML (`button`, `a`, `label`, `nav`, `main`).
- Every interactive element must have an accessible name.
- Do not build fake buttons or links with `div` + click handlers.
